                This part of the report presents two fixes two a respective issue found in the usability assessment and testing. 
                Prototype one addresses the confusing and unappealing “Updates” section, and prototype number two attempts to improve the accessibility of the Topic feature.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Prototype 1: Improved “Updates” Section
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The main issue of the updates section is the ambivalence of which entry is a notification, and which entry a recommendation. 
                To address this entanglement, my proposition is to address notifications, 
                which are updates that concern the interaction between other users with the user’s content, as a separate part before the most recent recommendations the algorithm produced.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="UpdatesDropdown.png">
                <p class="image-annotation">
                    Paper Prototype of the new drop-down menu
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Additionally, I propose adding a new website for Updates, which elaborates and expands on the updates and recommendations found in the drop-down menu:
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="UpdatesWebpage.jpg">
                <p class="image-annotation">
                    Paper Prototype of the new "Updates" website
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                With these changes in places, the minimalistic design of the website is better applied to the website and should make navigating updates more intuitive.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Prototype 2: Making Topics More Available
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The second issue addressed in this report are the topics, which are barely accessible once the user has selected them when creating their account. 
                My suggestion to mitigate the obscurity of adding topics would be to add a feature that allows users to access topics that correlate to a pin they are currently viewing.     
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="Topics.jpg">
                <p class="image-annotation">
                    Paper Prototype of the topics section on a pin
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Linking the topics feature with one of the main interfaces a user will interact with, the pin website itself, should make adding topics much easier.
            </p>
        </div>
